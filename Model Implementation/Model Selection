Model Selection 

Graph Neural Network 

Molecules are typically represented as graphs with nodes as atoms and edges as chemical bonds. Through message passing, GNNs can capture both local chemical properties and global molecular structures which makes them a great fit for deep learning models like GNNs. 

As molecular graphs preserve the full molecular structure, they also retain relational information. Thus, when molecular graphs are processed using a GNN, higher generalizability is achieved. 


Feed-Forward Neural Network using Sequential Model

Morgan fingerprints provide a compact, fixed-length representation of structures while preserving important chemical and structural features. They are a type of circular fingerprint repersenting chemical structures numerically and are generated using the extended-connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) algorithm which encodes based on connectivity patterns. We used 2048 bits.  

By comparing these two baseline models we can find which representation best captures molecular features for our project. 

Goal is to also explore how the ECFP algorithm encodes the 2048-bit vector. What would happen if we chose a subsection of the vector, perhaps the first half of the vector as our network input?
