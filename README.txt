So far our code is not condensed in one file, as we have been working on different aspects individually, but we plan to rectify that next. Relevant code can be found in DDI.ipynb, Data_Cleaning.ipynb, and preprocessing.py.

Data can be found in "drugbank.zip" (or "drugbank.csv.zip"),
"chembl_22_clean_1576904_sorted_std_final.csv.zip", and "drugs.txt"
